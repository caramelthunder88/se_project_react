# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Features

WTWR lets users view the current weather and get clothing recommendations accordingly. It includes a temperature toggle to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius, a profile page that displays all clothing items, and modals for adding or deleting clothing. Users can quickly manage their virtual wardrobe, and weather integration ensures that suggestions are based on real-time data.

## Technologies Used

This project is built with React and uses React Router for navigation and the Context API for managing global state like temperature units. Forms are handled with controlled components, and data is stored using json-server as a mock backend. The weather data comes from the OpenWeather API, and layout styling is done using CSS Flexbox and Grid. The UI design is based on a Figma prototype.
